Stapler Shooting:
Stapler Shooting is a test of precision and accuracy, challenging participants to launch staplers through the air with finesse. The rules are simple: each contestant stands at a designated starting point and aims to shoot staplers into a target area, such as a trash bin or a designated landing zone. Points are awarded based on proximity to the target or successful landings. The key to mastering this event lies in understanding the mechanics of the stapler, adjusting the angle and force of the launch, and maintaining consistent hand-eye coordination. Participants must also be mindful of safety, ensuring that no one is within the line of fire. Stapler Shooting encourages focus, dexterity, and a sense of friendly competition, injecting an element of excitement into the everyday office environment.

Paperclip Long Jump:
The Paperclip Long Jump takes the humble paperclip and transforms it into a tool for athletic prowess. In this event, participants aim to launch paperclips as far as possible, measuring their jumps from the starting point to the landing spot. The objective is to achieve the greatest distance while adhering to certain guidelines to ensure fairness. Participants can explore different techniques, such as bending the paperclip for aerodynamic advantage or experimenting with the launching angle. The Paperclip Long Jump encourages creativity, strategic thinking, and the ability to adapt to different launching conditions, all while fostering a spirit of friendly competition. This event adds a touch of playfulness and inventiveness to the office space, allowing colleagues to showcase their skills and engage in healthy rivalry.
